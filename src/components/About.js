        <h3>Software Engineer</h3>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          I am an Electrical and Computer Engineer who graduated from the
          University of Colorado Boulder in the Spring of 2019. I have two years
          of experience working as a software engineer in the aerospace sector
          and am hoping to venture into a new software field. I love creating,
          collaborating, and learning as much as I can in the process. I have
          always been fascinated with technology, which drove me to pursue this
          degree. I not only love programming and software, but also the complex
          machines that allow software to operate.
